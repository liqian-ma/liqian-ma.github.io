	<h2> Hi, I am <span itemprop="name">Liqian Ma</span>. </h2>
	<p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Physiology at the <a href="https://publish.illinois.edu/nelsonlab/">Nelson Lab</a>, where I study the mechanism by which 27-hydroxycholesterol promotes breast cancer metastasis.</p>
	<p>During my PhD, I have acquired skills in molecular biology and bioinformatics, including, but not limited to, primary cell culture, animal models, RNA sequencing analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and GWAS. I am also an advanced user of R and SAS for statistical analysis and data visualization.</p>
	<p>I have a strong interest in integrating <em> genomic studies </em> with <em>immuno-oncology</em> in my future career.</p>
	<p>Feel free to <a href="contact">contact</a> me if you are interested in working with me.</p>
