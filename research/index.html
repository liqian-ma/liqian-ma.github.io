  <p> Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among women in the US, mainly due to the metastatic recurrence. While advancements in research and medicine have largely improved the five-year survival of breast cancer patients, the treatment of recurrent breast cancer still remains a challenge. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify druggable targets to prevent the development of breast cancer to a metastatic stage.</p>
  <p> Obesity and high cholesterol are risk factors for breast cancer, but the exact mechanism of cholesterol-mediated breast cancer metastasis is unclear. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24288332">study</a> published in <em>Science</em> indicated the importance of a cholesterol metabolite, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), in linking cholesterol and breast cancer. Thus, the focus of my study is to provide the mechanistic insight to 27HC-driven breast cancer progression. </p>
